#Descriptions;
# Gwen: a kind young woman of average to slender build wearing a well-worn travelers outfit.  She has a short sword on her left hip, and a steel plate spell book on her right hip, marking her as a spell sword.
# Trevor: an angry looking older nobleman of a heavy build.  He's wearing fancy, expensive looking clothing, befitting of someone of his station.  While not visible, he has a dagger hidden on his person.

# Conversation and scene directions;
# SCENE: (Gwen, while reaching for her coin purse to pay the bar keep for her drink, accidentally spills the drink of the nobleman next to her, Trevor)
# Trevor: Spilling my drink is a slight I won't ignore!  Perhaps you ought to be taught some manners!
# Gwen: My apologies, my lord.  Let me buy you another!
# (Trevor speaks next)
# RESPONSE:
# Trevor: Hmph! Your apology comes far too late and is insincere! I want more than just a replacement drink. You will grovel at my feet for making such an unforgivable error!
